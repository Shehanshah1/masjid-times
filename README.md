# Masjid Times

A modern, responsive Next.js application designed to display prayer times (Adhan and Jamaat) for Masajid. This project is ideal for use on large TV screens or monitors within a masjid, as well as a public-facing website for community members.

## Features

* **Live Prayer Times**: Automatically calculates Adhan times based on your masjid's coordinates using the `adhan` library.
* **Manual Jamaat Updates**: A secure admin panel allows masjid staff to update Jamaat (congregation) times manually as they change throughout the year.
* **Next Prayer Countdown**: Displays a live clock and a real-time countdown to the next upcoming prayer.
* **Jumu'ah Support**: Support for multiple Jumu'ah khutbah and salah slots.
* **Adaptive Display**: The interface is designed to work in both portrait and landscape modes, making it versatile for different screen types.
* **Dual Storage**: Automatically uses the local filesystem for development and supports Vercel KV for cloud persistence in production.

## Tech Stack

* **Framework**: Next.js 16 (App Router)
* **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
* **Prayer Calculations**: Adhan.js
* **Database**: Vercel KV / Local JSON
* **Language**: TypeScript

## Getting Started

### 1. Configuration

To adapt this for your masjid, edit the configuration file at `src/config/masjid.ts`. You must provide your masjid's name, timezone, coordinates, and preferred calculation method:

```typescript
// src/config/masjid.ts
export const masjid = {
  name: "Your Masjid Name",
  timezone: "America/Chicago", // Your local timezone
  coordinates: { lat: 31.3271, lon: -89.2903 }, // Your latitude and longitude
  calc: {
    method: "NORTH_AMERICA", // Calculation method
    fajrAngle: 18,  
    ishaAngle: 18,
    madhab: "HANAFI", // HANAFI or SHAFI
  },
};

```

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add a passcode for the admin panel. If you are deploying to Vercel, you will also need the KV credentials.

```env
ADMIN_PASSCODE=your_secure_passcode_here
KV_REST_API_URL=...
KV_REST_API_TOKEN=...

```

### 3. Installation & Development

Run the following commands to get started locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000/display](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000/display) to see the live board or [http://localhost:3000/admin](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:3000/admin) to log in and update times.

## Admin Panel

The admin panel is accessible at `/admin`. It requires the `ADMIN_PASSCODE` you set in your environment variables to log in. Once logged in, you can:

* Update Jamaat times for the five daily prayers.
* Add or remove multiple Jumu'ah prayer slots.
* Changes are synchronized across both local storage and the cloud (if configured).

## Deployment

This project is optimized for the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new). When deploying:

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel.
2. Add your `ADMIN_PASSCODE` to the Environment Variables in the Vercel dashboard.
3. For persistent storage, add the **Vercel KV** integration to your project.

## Project Structure

* `src/app/display/page.tsx`: The public prayer board interface.
* `src/app/admin/page.tsx`: The password-protected management interface.
* `src/lib/db.ts`: Logic for reading and writing jamaat times to storage.
* `src/lib/time.ts`: Utilities for time formatting and timezone handling.
* `data/jamaat.json`: Local storage file for prayer times (created automatically).
